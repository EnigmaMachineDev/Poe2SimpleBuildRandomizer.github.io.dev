Currently, this application has tight coupling to the order in which class, weapon, main skills, and defense strategy are rolled. 
I want to make this application a bit more simple, and a bit easier for users to reroll things they do not want or want to change without having to reroll everything else in the process.

1. Remove the attribute sections from classes, defense types, and weapons in randomizer.json.
2. Remove the weaponCompatibility section from randomizer.json.
3. Combine WeaponType and Main Skill(s) Sections. Instead of the current logic, use skills in randomizer.json. First roll a weapon from it, and then roll 1-3 skills from inside that weapon's skill array.
4. Remove the restrictions so that each of class and ascendency, weapontype and main skills, and defense strategy can be rolled seperately from their respective sections in randomizer.json after the attribute restrictions have been removed.
