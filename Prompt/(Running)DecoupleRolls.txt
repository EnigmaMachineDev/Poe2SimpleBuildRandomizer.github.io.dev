Currently, this application has tight coupling to the order in which class, weapon, main skills, and defense strategy are rolled. 
I want to make this application a bit more simple, and a bit easier for users to reroll things they do not want or want to change without having to reroll everything else in the process.

1. Remove the attribute sections from classes, defense types, and weapons in randomizer.json.
2. Remove the weaponCompatibility section from randomizer.json.
3. Combine WeaponType and Main Skill(s) Sections. Instead of the current logic, use skills in randomizer.json. First roll a weapon from it, and then roll 1-3 skills from inside that weapon's skill array.
4. Remove the restrictions so that each of class and ascendency, weapontype and main skills, and defense strategy can be rolled seperately from their respective sections in randomizer.json after the attribute restrictions have been removed.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


When you decoupled the rolls you changed randomizer.json completely to use path of exile 1 classes, weapons, and skills. Please revert this change to use poe 2 classes weapons and skills. 
Reference randomizerReference file to make this change (it is a copy of the old buildData).

When the app was more complicated and coupled, there were certain classes that had certain skills added to the list. I still want those class specific skills to be rollable.
Please reference ascendencySkillReference, and based on that, when that specific class has been rolled, the rollable main skills should include those ascendency specific skills. 
It should be part of the skill pool regardless of weapon when the roll all button is clicked if the class is one of the classes in the list, and it should be available to reroll to if the current class is one of the classes in the list.

For example if I am a pathfinder, regardless of what the primary weapon is, I should be able to roll the pathfinder skills from the reference:
["Bleeding Concoction", "Poison Concoction", "Shattering Concoction","Fulminating Concoction", "Explosive Concoction"]
